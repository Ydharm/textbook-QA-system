# Question Answering System

## Overview
This repository hosts a Question Answering (QA) system designed to provide accurate responses to user queries based on contextual understanding. It utilizes [insert technology or framework] to process natural language input and extract relevant information from a given context or knowledge base.

## Key Features
- **Contextual Understanding:** Leverages [describe model or approach] for comprehending context and identifying pertinent details.
- **Question Types:** Supports various question types including factual, reasoning-based, and more complex queries through [describe question processing techniques].
- **Scalability:** Engineered for efficiency with the ability to scale for larger datasets and diverse domains.
- **Customizability:** Easily adaptable for different use cases and datasets by modifying [mention configuration files, scripts, etc.].

## Example Usage
1. **Input:** What is ReLU function in Deep Learning.
   
2. **Output:** A ReLU activation can be computed and stored more efciently than a
sigmoid activation

## Dataset and Models
- **Dataset:** [Here I add three books in my data folder and for QA system I used the ML_BOOK.pdf ]
- **Example Libraries and Tools:**
BeautifulSoup: For web scraping and HTML parsing.
pdfminer: For extracting text from PDF files.
NLTK: For natural language processing tasks including stemming and tokenization.
spaCy: For advanced NLP tasks like entity recognition and dependency parsing.
Hugging Face Transformers: For pre-trained language models and pipelines.

## Roadmap
-**Content Extraction:**
For extracting content from textbooks, you can use libraries like BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing if the textbooks are in digital format, or pdfminer if they are in PDF format. These tools will help in extracting text accurately from each page or section.

-**Hierarchical Tree-based Indexing:**
To create a hierarchical tree-based index, you can structure the content into nodes representing the textbook, chapters, sections, and subsections. Use Python's built-in data structures like dictionaries or custom classes to represent these nodes. No specific pre-trained models are needed for this stage, but efficient data structuring and management are crucial.

-**Retrieval Techniques:**
Query Expansion: Use NLTK or spaCy for techniques like synonym expansion and stemming to enhance query terms.

**Hybrid Retrieval Methods:**

BM25: Implement using the rank_bm25 library in Python for traditional keyword-based retrieval.
DPR (Dense Passage Retrieval): Utilize the facebook/dpr library for dense retrievals based on embeddings.
SPIDER (Semantic Passage Retrieval): Implement using transformers like Hugging Face's transformers library for semantic retrieval.
